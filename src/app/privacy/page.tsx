          <p>
            Coco (&quot;we,&quot; &quot;our,&quot; or &quot;us&quot;) provides support and resources for caregivers and families. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our website, app, or services. Please read it carefully.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            We may collect information that you provide directly (such as name, email, phone number, and account details), information collected automatically when you use our services (such as device type, IP address, and usage data), and information from third parties where you have given permission (e.g., calendar or contact access to support care coordination).
          </p>

          <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            We use your information to provide, maintain, and improve our services; to communicate with you; to personalize your experience; to send updates and support materials; to comply with legal obligations; and to protect the security of our users and services.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with service providers who assist our operations (under strict confidentiality), with your consent, or when required by law. We do not share health or care-related data with advertisers.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
          <p>
            We use industry-standard measures to protect your data, including encryption and access controls. Despite our efforts, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on your location, you may have the right to access, correct, delete, or port your data, and to object to or restrict certain processing. You can update your preferences or request changes by contacting us at{' '}

          <h2>6. Children and Sensitive Data</h2>
          <p>
            Our services are not directed to children under 13. When you use Coco in a caregiving context, you may provide information about dependents or family members. We treat such information with the same care as your own and use it only as necessary to provide the services you request.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the revised policy on this page and update the &quot;Last updated&quot; date. Continued use of our services after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
